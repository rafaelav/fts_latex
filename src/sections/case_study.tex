Mars Climate Orbiter (MCO) was part of the NASA Mars Surveyor program which
included the Mars Global Surveyor as well as Mars Polar Lander. It was launched
in 1998 with the main objective of studying the climate of Mars. It aimed to
monitor atmospheric dust and water vapor as well as taking pictures of the
planet's surface in order to gain insight on the climatic changes. The hope was
to gather evidences that would suport the theory of existing water underneat the
surface of the planet.

MCO was also designed to serve as a communication relay for the Mars Polar
Lander, however after the Lander's mission, it was supposed to conduct its own
main mission independently.

After its nine months jurney to Mars, MCO was lost beacuse it missed its planned
altitude ordbit and fell into the Martian atmosphere where it was distroyed.

The problem identified in the NASA Mishap Investigation Board Phase I Report was
that the MCO failed to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file
used in trajectory models. Other causes that contributed to the failure of the
mission included system engineering, traning and organizational factors.

In order to understand better the circumstances that lead to the failure of this
mission, we need to take a closer look at the Attitude Control System and
the fault protection architecture of the MCO\cite{surv-nasa-mars}.

The MCO's Attitude Control System contained a sun sensor, an inertial
measurement unit, a star camera and reaction wheels. The MCO was controlable in
roll, pitch and yaw so that it can adjust its alttitude, to perform trajectory
maneuvres and to achieve Mars Orbit Inseration. It was designed so that it could
use the gravity force of Mars in order to adjust to the needed velocity which
could allow it to keep the desired orbit and altitude. The design included
rocket engine modules which allowed this as well as serving as elements that
dissipaed any angular momentum which could be accumulated in the reaction
wheels.
